Directly from your old phone, your favorite bathroom game!

In Snake '98 you will remember how cool, and hard, it was to get a high score in *almost the only game* for your phone (because in the old days this game, if not the only available game, at least was the most fun).

Now instead of letting the score only ni your mobile phone, you can show your friends how good you are sharing your records directly from the game!

Some features:
- Share your records with friends
- Save your highest record in your phone
- (in the roadmap) Purchase items to use in-game
- (in the roadmap) Keep track of other players scores with a unifyed score server
- (in the roadmap) Play through other levels with increasing difficulty or just play arcade
